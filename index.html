        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Customers can share the initial finished English draft via my email address or WeChat.</li>
            <li>I’ll review your document and provide an estimated price, typically $85 per 1,000 words. The price may be adjusted if additional requirements are requested, such as reducing the document to a specific word count.</li>
            <li>If you agree to the price, payment can be made via Zelle, Venmo, or WeChat. Once payment is confirmed, I’ll return your polished document within 24-72 hours, depending on the current order queue.</li>
